# NoteBook-ui
Greetings
This software is the same software **[NoteBook](https://github.com/ashkan0201/NoteBook)** that we made and showed how to use object orientation.
Now we gave the same example with an interaction design and made a ui application.

The program has three buttons

**First button:** `Enter Item`

**Second button:** `Show Item`

**Third button:** `Delete Item`


In the first button, you can add a series of captions and comments
Or you can view them in the second button, and again in this button you can view them individually or based on all data.
In the third button, you can delete the data based on the ID or the total amount of data

The data is stored in the `NoteBook.json` file
